# Locations, Arcs, and Valid Arcs

Use a `$` to refer to a certain column and `[i]` is the row index. These will be turned into dataframes.

Things to think about with arcs:
- If using chunks, you could make a function to assemble each chunk
- scales with workorders

chunking
- hierchical structures with chunking.
- clusters by divergence.
- or clusters by diversity.
- or clusters by distance
- or clusters by workorder similarity
- clusters by driver lots of overnights?
- clusters by reducing availability after each chunk
- we're actually chunking workorders
- cluster by time constraint
- penalize incomplete workorders in relation to the due date.


## Part 1: Locations

Size of locations = 2(drivers COUNT + workorders COUNT)


```{r}

workorders <- read_csv("Chunked_Workorders.csv")
workorders<- workorders %>% filter(Chunk_Random == 1)
drivers <- read_csv("Drivers2.csv")
mileage_csv <- read_csv("MileageMatrix.csv")
locations <- mileage_csv$Origination
mileage <- as.matrix(mileage_csv[,-1]) # everything except the first column
rownames(mileage) <- locations
mileage[is.na(mileage)] <- 0
# 1. Remove extra spaces around commas
colnames(mileage) <- gsub("\\s*,\\s*", ", ", colnames(mileage))

# 2. Trim leading/trailing whitespace just in case
colnames(mileage) <- trimws(colnames(mileage))



# Thanks ChatGPT:

locations <- bind_rows(
  workorders %>%
    transmute(
      location = Origination,
      purpose  = "pickup",
      entity   = WorkOrderNumber
    ),
  workorders %>%
    transmute(
      location = Destination,
      purpose  = "dropoff",
      entity   = WorkOrderNumber
    ),
  drivers %>%
    transmute(
      location = Start_location,
      purpose  = "start",
      entity   = DriverID
    ),
  drivers %>%
    transmute(
      location = End_location,
      purpose  = "end",
      entity   = DriverID
    )
)

locations
```

## Part 2: Valid Connections

```{r}
valid_connections <- tibble(
  from = c("start", "start", "pickup", "pickup", "dropoff", "dropoff", "dropoff"),
  to = c("pickup", "end", "pickup", "dropoff", "pickup", "dropoff", "end")
)

```

## Part 3: Arcs

Size of Arcs = 2(drivers COUNT + workorders COUNT)(drivers COUNT + workorders COUNT - .5)

(Approximated due to filtering)

```{r}
